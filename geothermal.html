	  <p>Using a Harbor Hybrid Energy Exchanger is a great way to increase overall GSHP system efficiency, conserve our natural resources and limit additional expenses as seen in  the vertical and horizontal closed loop systems. Harbor Hybrid Energy Exchangers are ideally suited for industrial, commercial, and residential applications within urban areas where space is limited, such as an urban subdivision. As well, HHEEs become a great application outside of urban growth boundaries within a country setting. Consumers with this Geothermal system, including the domestic water well costs and entire HVAC mechanical system in a home retrofitted or new, would receive the stimulus bill tax credit of 30% for GSHP units, just as wind or solar systems do. The utility companies also offer a rebate of around $2000.00 to the consumer. Check with your accountant and your local utility company to see if you qualify for generous tax rebates and utility company rebates for geothermal systems!
